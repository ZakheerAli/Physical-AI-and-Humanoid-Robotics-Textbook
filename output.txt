Here's how you can obtain the necessary credentials for Qdrant, Neon, and Google Cloud:

### Qdrant Cloud Credentials (`QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`)

1.  **Go to Qdrant Cloud:** Open your web browser and navigate to [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/).
2.  **Sign Up or Log In:** Create an account or log in if you already have one.
3.  **Create a Cluster:** Once logged in, look for an option to "Create Cluster" or "New Deployment." Choose a plan (they usually offer a free tier for testing).
4.  **Access Cluster Details:** After your cluster is provisioned (this might take a few minutes), navigate to its details page. You should find:
    *   **`QDRANT_URL`**: This will be the "Endpoint" or "Host" of your cluster. It typically looks like `https://<your-cluster-id>.qdrant.tech`.
    *   **`QDRANT_API_KEY`**: This will be listed as your "API Key" or "Service Key." Keep this secure.

### Neon Serverless PostgreSQL Credentials (`NEON_DATABASE_URL`)

1.  **Go to Neon.tech:** Open your web browser and navigate to [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/).
2.  **Sign Up or Log In:** Create an account or log in if you already have one.
3.  **Create a Project:** Once logged in, create a new project. A default database will usually be created within it.
4.  **Get Connection String:** On your project dashboard, find the "Connection Details" or "Connect" section for your database. You will see various connection options. Copy the "Connection String" (or "Direct Connection String").
    *   **`NEON_DATABASE_URL`**: This will be a URL that starts with `postgresql://` and includes your username, password, host, port, and database name. Example: `postgresql://[user]:[password]@[neon-host]/[db-name]?sslmode=require`.

### Google Cloud Project ID and Location (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`)

1.  **Go to Google Cloud Console:** Open your web browser and navigate to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  **Sign Up or Log In:** Create an account or log in. You may need to set up billing, but many services have free tiers.
3.  **Select or Create a Project:**
    *   **To select an existing project:** Use the project selector dropdown at the top of the page.
    *   **To create a new project:** Click on the project selector dropdown, then "New Project."
    *   **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`**: Once a project is selected or created, you can find its Project ID on the project dashboard. It's usually a unique string (e.g., `my-project-123456`). You can also get it by running `gcloud config get-value project` if you have the Google Cloud SDK installed.
4.  **Enable Vertex AI API:**
    *   In the Google Cloud Console search bar, type "Vertex AI API" and select it.
    *   Click "Enable" if the API is not already enabled for your project.
5.  **Choose a Location:**
    *   **`GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`**: This is the geographic region where your Vertex AI resources will be deployed. Common choices include `us-central1`, `europe-west4`, etc. You will typically select this when you create specific Vertex AI resources. For a list of available locations, you can refer to the [Vertex AI documentation on regions](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/general/locations). You should use a location that is geographically close to your users for better performance.

Once you have these values, update your `backend/.env` file with them.
