# Data Model

This project is a static website and does not involve a database or complex data models. The primary data structure is the content itself, organized as follows:

*   **Part**: A top-level section of the book (e.g., "Part 1 - Foundations"). Each part will have its own directory.
    *   **Chapter**: A markdown file (`.mdx`) within a part's directory. Each chapter represents a specific topic within that part.
        *   **Content**: The content within each chapter file will consist of text, images, code snippets, and mathematical formulas.
