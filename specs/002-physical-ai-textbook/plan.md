# Project Plan: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Summary

This project aims to create a comprehensive online textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics using Docusaurus. The development will follow a structured approach, prioritizing design and technical setup before focusing on content creation, to ensure a high-quality and maintainable final product.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Design and User Experience (UX)

This phase focuses on establishing the visual and interactive foundation of the textbook.

*   **Objective:** Define the overall look, feel, navigation, and user experience of the Docusaurus website.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Define aesthetic guidelines, color palettes, and typography.
    *   Design the navigation structure (sidebar, navbar, footer).
    *   Establish UI/UX principles for readability and engagement.
    *   Plan for any custom components or page layouts.
    *   Ensure accessibility standards are considered.

### Phase 2: Technical Setup and Infrastructure

This phase involves setting up the technical environment and resolving core infrastructure issues.

*   **Objective:** Establish a stable and functional Docusaurus development environment capable of supporting all content and features.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Verify Docusaurus project setup and dependencies.
    *   Configure Docusaurus (e.g., `docusaurus.config.ts`, `sidebars.ts`) to align with the design plan.
    *   Resolve any outstanding technical issues, such as MDX compilation errors related to LaTeX or other syntax.
    *   Integrate necessary plugins and libraries (e.g., KaTeX, Mermaid).
    *   Set up local development and build processes.

### Phase 3: Content Creation and Refinement

This phase focuses on populating the textbook with detailed and engaging content.

*   **Objective:** Write, review, and integrate all chapters, modules, examples, and interactive components.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Draft and review content for all chapters as defined in `tasks.md`.
    *   Add relevant images, diagrams, and media.
    *   Integrate code snippets and ensure their correctness.
    *   Implement interactive components or simulations where planned.
    *   Ensure content adheres to technical accuracy and style guidelines.

### Phase 4: Testing and Deployment

This phase involves thorough testing and making the textbook publicly available.

*   **Objective:** Ensure the website is fully functional, bug-free, and deployed to a hosting platform.
*   **Key Activities:**
    *   Run local development server and verify all pages render correctly.
    *   Test all internal links and navigation.
    *   Verify KaTeX formulas and Mermaid diagrams display correctly.
    *   Configure deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages workflow).
    *   Deploy the website and verify accessibility.
