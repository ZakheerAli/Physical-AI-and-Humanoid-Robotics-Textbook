# Quickstart Guide

This guide explains how to get the project running locally for development and contribution.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js (version 16.14 or later)
*   npm or yarn

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-physical-ai-book/frontend
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
2.  **Open your browser:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the site. The site will automatically reload when you make changes to the source files.

## Building for Production

To create a static production build of the website, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the `build` directory, which can then be deployed to a web server or a service like GitHub Pages.
